# usermanager
Initialized react environment using create-react-app
And this project has certain components which divides the complex ui into smaller parts
navbar - for rendering navigation part of user interface
userform - to render form which also possess client side validations and this responsive form is to add new user in database
userList - to render current users in homepage
Listofusers - to render each current user and also has edit and delete functionalities by clicking edit button table element becomes input element
And this project took me 4 hours to complete I used some basic react concepts which i Learned.
And the challenges faced by me are to implement crud operation
and designing this application in a responsive way.
And also to make api integeration using browser fetch method
Used component Life cycle method
Used both class and functional components.
Included conditional rendering during various api status
If api status got failed it reloads the entire application since my main focus was to build front end i used mock api's for handling data
I used jsonplaceholder which won't persist data so application data won't persist reloads has future ideas to create server and database using node and sql to create backend
Also has plans to increase client side validation efficiency to validate data more precisely in client side
