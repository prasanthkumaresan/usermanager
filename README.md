Created react environment using create-react-app command.
And I divided the complex ui into multiple smaller chunks of components
Navbar - created responsive navigation bar
userform - created form component to add new users by making http request to server
userList - displays current user list in screen
listofusers - created edit and delete functionalities to manipulate user details after created
It took 4 hours to complete this project
Difficulties faced are implemeting crud operations, designing in responsive way and to make api integrations
Has future plans to build back end to take control over data handling
